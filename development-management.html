<p class="paragraph">Pilot Development Partners, Inc. and its staff have managed over three million square feet of development and construction projects. Although there are many similarities from project to project, each one has its own challenges. Our work includes actively helping clients establish development goals that reinforce their business plans and the development potential of available sites.</p>
<h3 class="sub-heading">Planning & Analysis</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Planning is key for successful development. Defining the project, understanding the resources required, and recognizing the risks and constraints, provide the best opportunity for successful development. - please see Development Planning -</p>
<h3 class="sub-heading">Design and Construction Control</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Pilot has the technical expertise to review and determine that architecture, engineering and construction are meeting the ownerâ€™s goals for quality, program needs and budget. Budget control is often a priority, and Pilot has been particularly successful at managing development to budget.</p>
<h3 class="sub-heading">Resources</h3>
<p class="paragraph">It is anticipated that clients' needs for financing will be highly individual. We can provide clients with adequate tools and information with which to obtain the necessary funding for their projects. This includes pro forma development and investment analysis, financing information packages, and funding contacts. Depending upon the client and the complexity of their needs, we may provide all of the services in-house or may retain outside advisers on the client's behalf.</p>
<h3 class="sub-heading">Administration</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Pilot manages performance, payments, permits, insurance, warranties and all project documentation. Our accounting and reporting are exemplary, and have been performed for major banks and institutional investors, as well as private property owners.</p>
