	<p class="paragraph">Pilot was founded in 1994 by principal Eden Milroy to address a strong need for independent development management and advice. Pilot has subsequently provided its clients with accurate guidance and responsible management for office buildings, reasearch and development facilities, apartment complexes, and industrial plants. In 1998, this successful consulting effort encouraged Pilot to participate in direct project ownership with investors. Mr. Milroy with partner Fred Kempton, formed Pilot Investments LLC to pursue real estate and development acquisitions. Today, our years of consulting and management are profoundly informed by our direct investment experience as commercial and apartment building owners.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">What distinguishes Pilot from other consulting firms is that we combine professional backgrounds with an owner’s point of view. Many of the members of our team hold professional credentials such as architecture or engineering. This unique perspective allows us to recognize complex issues that owners may need to balance, and to solve their problems which require an expert knowledge of real estate, facilities, finance and development.</p>
