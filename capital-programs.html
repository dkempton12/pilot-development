<h1 class="title-heading">Capital Improvements</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Capital improvement programs represent an area where Pilot Development Partners, Inc. has been especially effective. Many properties need improvements that may be beyond the normal experience of owners, property managers or facilities staff to manage directly. Important components of buildings deteriorate, or become obsolete. Owners may want to reposition their structures for refinancing, for change of use, to implement major energy improvements or to maximize sale value. From energy improvement programs to major renovations, Pilot has the expertise to manage the capital improvement process, even when buildings must remain fully occupied.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="sub-sub-heading bold">Planning and Programming: </span>Pilot assists owners in identifying issues and determining the best course of action. Planning activities include assisting our clients to balance program, budget, schedule and resources. Pilot will devise a plan to make the capital improvements process predictable and manageable for both building owners and occupants.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="sub-sub-heading bold">Design and Construction: </span>We engage appropriate architects, engineers and contractors on behalf of the owner. Construction purchasing and management is a particular strength at Pilot. We can ensure the best combination of cost and performance for our clients.</p>
